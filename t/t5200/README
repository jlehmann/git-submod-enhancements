The url data files in this directory contain URLs with characters
in the range 0x01-0x1f and 0x7f-0xff to test the proper normalization
of unprintable characters.

A select few characters in the 0x01-0x1f range are skipped to help
avoid problems running the test itself.

The urls are in test files in this directory rather than being
embedded in the test script for portability.

The config data files in this directory represent configurations
to be parsed by http_options so that the final option value can be
tested.

The config files may contain more than one same-named section to
simulate having a system, global and .git config file.
