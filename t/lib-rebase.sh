# After setting the fake editor with this function, you can
#
# - override the commit message with $FAKE_COMMIT_MESSAGE,
# - amend the commit message with $FAKE_COMMIT_AMEND
# - check that non-commit messages have a certain line count with $EXPECT_COUNT
# - rewrite a rebase -i script with $FAKE_LINES in the form
#
#	"[<lineno1>] [<lineno2>]..."
#
#   If a line number is prefixed with "squash", "fixup", "edit", or
#   "reword", the respective line's command will be replaced with the
#   specified one.
