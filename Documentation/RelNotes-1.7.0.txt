Git v1.7.0 Release Notes
========================

Notes on behaviour change
-------------------------

 * "git push" into a branch that is currently checked out (i.e. pointed by
   HEAD in a repository that is not bare) is refused by default.

   Similarly, "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch $killed
   in a remote repository $there, when $killed branch is the current
   branch pointed at by its HEAD, will be refused by default.

   Setting the configuration variables receive.denyCurrentBranch and
   receive.denyDeleteCurrent to 'ignore' in the receiving repository
   can be used to override these safety features.

 * "git send-email" does not make deep threads by default when sending a
   patch series with more than two messages.  All messages will be sent
   as a reply to the first message, i.e. cover letter.

   It has been possible to configure send-email to send "shallow thread"
   by setting sendemail.chainreplyto configuration variable to false.  The
   only thing this release does is to change the default when you haven't
   configured that variable.

 * "git status" is not "git commit --dry-run" anymore.  This change does
   not affect you if you run the command without pathspec.

 * "git diff" traditionally treated various "ignore whitespace" options
   only as a way to filter the patch output.  "git diff --exit-code -b"
   exited with non-zero status even if all changes were about changing the
   ammount of whitespace and nothing else.  and "git diff -b" showed the
   "diff --git" header line for such a change without patch text.

   In this release, the "ignore whitespaces" options affect the semantics
   of the diff operation.  A change that does not affect anything but
   whitespaces is reported with zero exit status when run with
   --exit-code, and there is no "diff --git" header for such a change.


Updates since v1.6.6
--------------------

(subsystems)

(portability)

(performance)

(usability, bells and whistles)

 * "git commit --date='<date>'" can be used to override the author date
   just like "git commit --author='<name> <email>'" can be used to
   override the author identity.

 * "git status" learned "-s(hort)" output format.


Fixes since v1.6.6
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.6.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.
