--[no-]recurse-submodules::
	Using --recurse-submodules will update the content of all initialized
	submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject.If
	local modifications in a submodule would be overwritten the checkout
	will fail until `-f` is used. If nothing (or --no-recurse-submodules)
	is used, the work trees of submodules will not be updated, only the
	hash recorded in the superproject will be changed.
