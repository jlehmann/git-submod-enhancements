--[no-]recurse-submodules::
	Using --recurse-submodules will update the work tree of all
	initialized submodules according to the commit recorded in the
	superproject if their update configuration is set to checkout'. If
	local modifications in a submodule would be overwritten the checkout
	will fail unless forced. Without this option or with
	--no-recurse-submodules is, the work trees of submodules will not be
	updated, only the hash recorded in the superproject will be updated.
