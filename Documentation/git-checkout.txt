NAME
----
git-checkout - Checkout a branch or paths to the working tree

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git checkout' [-q] [-f] [-m] [<branch>]
'git checkout' [-q] [-f] [-m] [[-b|--orphan] <new_branch>] [<start_point>]
'git checkout' [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=<style>] [<tree-ish>] [--] <paths>...
'git checkout' --patch [<tree-ish>] [--] [<paths>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

When <paths> are not given, this command switches branches by
updating the index, working tree, and HEAD to reflect the specified
branch.

If `-b` is given, a new branch is created and checked out, as if
linkgit:git-branch[1] were called; in this case you can
use the --track or --no-track options, which will be passed to `git
branch`.  As a convenience, --track without `-b` implies branch
creation; see the description of --track below.

When <paths> or --patch are given, this command does *not* switch
branches.  It updates the named paths in the working tree from
the index file, or from a named <tree-ish> (most often a commit).  In
this case, the `-b` and `--track` options are meaningless and giving
either of them results in an error. The <tree-ish> argument can be
used to specify a specific tree-ish (i.e. commit, tag or tree)
to update the index for the given paths before updating the
working tree.

The index may contain unmerged entries after a failed merge.  By
default, if you try to check out such an entry from the index, the
checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked out.
Using -f will ignore these unmerged entries.  The contents from a
specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by
using --ours or --theirs.  With -m, changes made to the working tree
file can be discarded to recreate the original conflicted merge result.

OPTIONS
-------
-q::
--quiet::
	Quiet, suppress feedback messages.

-f::
--force::
	When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the
	working tree differs from HEAD.  This is used to throw away
	local changes.
+
When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged
entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.

--ours::
--theirs::
	When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2
	('ours') or #3 ('theirs') for unmerged paths.

-b::
	Create a new branch named <new_branch> and start it at
	<start_point>; see linkgit:git-branch[1] for details.

-t::
--track::
	When creating a new branch, set up "upstream" configuration. See
	"--track" in linkgit:git-branch[1] for details.
+
If no '-b' option is given, the name of the new branch will be
derived from the remote branch.  If "remotes/" or "refs/remotes/"
is prefixed it is stripped away, and then the part up to the
next slash (which would be the nickname of the remote) is removed.
This would tell us to use "hack" as the local branch when branching
off of "origin/hack" (or "remotes/origin/hack", or even
"refs/remotes/origin/hack").  If the given name has no slash, or the above
guessing results in an empty name, the guessing is aborted.  You can
explicitly give a name with '-b' in such a case.

--no-track::
	Do not set up "upstream" configuration, even if the
	branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable is true.

-l::
	Create the new branch's reflog; see linkgit:git-branch[1] for
	details.

--orphan::
	Create a new branch named <new_branch>, unparented to any other
	branch.  The new branch you switch to does not have any commit
	and after the first one it will become the root of a new history
	completely unconnected from all the other branches.
+
When you use "--orphan", the index and the working tree are kept intact.
This allows you to start a new history that records set of paths similar
to that of the start-point commit, which is useful when you want to keep
different branches for different audiences you are working to like when
you have an open source and commercial versions of a software, for example.
+
If you want to start a disconnected history that records set of paths
totally different from the original branch, you may want to first clear
the index and the working tree, by running "git rm -rf ." from the
top-level of the working tree, before preparing your files (by copying
from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.) in the working tree.

-m::
--merge::
	When switching branches,
	if you have local modifications to one or more files that
	are different between the current branch and the branch to
	which you are switching, the command refuses to switch
	branches in order to preserve your modifications in context.
	However, with this option, a three-way merge between the current
	branch, your working tree contents, and the new branch
	is done, and you will be on the new branch.
+
When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting
paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts
and mark the resolved paths with `git add` (or `git rm` if the merge
should result in deletion of the path).
+
When checking out paths from the index, this option lets you recreate
the conflicted merge in the specified paths.

--conflict=<style>::
	The same as --merge option above, but changes the way the
	conflicting hunks are presented, overriding the
	merge.conflictstyle configuration variable.  Possible values are
	"merge" (default) and "diff3" (in addition to what is shown by
	"merge" style, shows the original contents).

-p::
--patch::
	Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
	<tree-ish> (or the index, if unspecified) and the working
	tree.  The chosen hunks are then applied in reverse to the
	working tree (and if a <tree-ish> was specified, the index).
+
This means that you can use `git checkout -p` to selectively discard
edits from your current working tree.

--ignore-submodules::
	Since version 1.8.0 the default behavior is to checkout populated
	submodules recursively. When this option is used, the work trees of
	submodules will not be updated, only the hash recorded in the
	superproject will be changed (this was the default behavior until
	1.8.0).

<branch>::
	Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a name that,
	when prepended with "refs/heads/", is a valid ref), then that
	branch is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid
	commit, your HEAD becomes "detached" and you are no longer on
	any branch (see below for details).
+
As a special case, the `"@\{-N\}"` syntax for the N-th last branch
checks out the branch (instead of detaching).  You may also specify
`-` which is synonymous with `"@\{-1\}"`.

<new_branch>::
	Name for the new branch.

<start_point>::
	The name of a commit at which to start the new branch; see
	linkgit:git-branch[1] for details. Defaults to HEAD.

<tree-ish>::
	Tree to checkout from (when paths are given). If not specified,
	the index will be used.



Detached HEAD
-------------

It is sometimes useful to be able to 'checkout' a commit that is
not at the tip of one of your branches.  The most obvious
example is to check out the commit at a tagged official release
point, like this:

------------
$ git checkout v2.6.18
------------

Earlier versions of git did not allow this and asked you to
create a temporary branch using the `-b` option, but starting from
version 1.5.0, the above command 'detaches' your HEAD from the
current branch and directly points at the commit named by the tag
(`v2.6.18` in the example above).

You can use all git commands while in this state.  You can use
`git reset --hard $othercommit` to further move around, for
example.  You can make changes and create a new commit on top of
a detached HEAD.  You can even create a merge by using `git
merge $othercommit`.

The state you are in while your HEAD is detached is not recorded
by any branch (which is natural --- you are not on any branch).
What this means is that you can discard your temporary commits
and merges by switching back to an existing branch (e.g. `git
checkout master`), and a later `git prune` or `git gc` would
garbage-collect them.  If you did this by mistake, you can ask
the reflog for HEAD where you were, e.g.

------------
$ git log -g -2 HEAD
------------


EXAMPLES
--------

. The following sequence checks out the `master` branch, reverts
the `Makefile` to two revisions back, deletes hello.c by
mistake, and gets it back from the index.
+
------------
$ git checkout master             <1>
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile  <2>
$ rm -f hello.c
$ git checkout hello.c            <3>
------------
+
<1> switch branch
<2> take a file out of another commit
<3> restore hello.c from the index
+
If you have an unfortunate branch that is named `hello.c`, this
step would be confused as an instruction to switch to that branch.
You should instead write:
+
------------
$ git checkout -- hello.c
------------

. After working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct
branch would be done using:
+
------------
$ git checkout mytopic
------------
+
However, your "wrong" branch and correct "mytopic" branch may
differ in files that you have modified locally, in which case
the above checkout would fail like this:
+
------------
$ git checkout mytopic
fatal: Entry 'frotz' not uptodate. Cannot merge.
------------
+
You can give the `-m` flag to the command, which would try a
three-way merge:
+
------------
$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
------------
+
After this three-way merge, the local modifications are _not_
registered in your index file, so `git diff` would show you what
changes you made since the tip of the new branch.

. When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with
the `-m` option, you would see something like this:
+
------------
$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
fatal: merge program failed
------------
+
At this point, `git diff` shows the changes cleanly merged as in
the previous example, as well as the changes in the conflicted
files.  Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with
`git add` as usual:
+
------------
$ edit frotz
$ git add frotz
------------
